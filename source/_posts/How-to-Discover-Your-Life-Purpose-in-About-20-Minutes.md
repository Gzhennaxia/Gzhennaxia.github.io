如何寻找你真正的人生目标？我不是在谈你的工作、责任抑或是长期目标。我想谈的是你为什么存在的真正原因——你存在的意义。

或许你是一个不相信人生目的或人生意义的极现实主义者。不过这不重要，不相信你有存在的意义，并不妨碍你找到它，就像苹果不相信万有引力，但还是会自然下落一样。不相信只会让拉长寻找的进程，所以，如果你是这样的人，那把标题的20分钟拉长到40分钟(或者60分钟，如果你真的特别固执的话)。最坏情况是不管我说什么你都不相信你有存在的意义，及时这样，花费这一个小时对你能有多大损失，万一你真的找到了呢？

李小龙的一个故事能为这个练习做个小小的铺垫。一个武术大师请李小龙把自己知道的所有功夫都教给他。李小龙端起两杯盛满水的杯子说道，这个杯里的水是你所知道的功夫，另一杯里的是我所知道的，如果你想要我全部的功夫，那你得先把你那杯倒了。

如果你想寻找你真正的人生意义，你首先要做的事情是先放空你的大脑，清空所有外界灌输给你的认知(包括你不相信你有存在的意义这一点)。

那么如何找到你的人生目标呢？虽然有很多方法都可以做到，但有些方法非常繁杂，我所介绍的方法任何人都可以轻易的做到。你对这个过程越开放，越期望它起作用，它对你的起效就越快。再重申一遍，即使你不抱有开放的心态，或者不相信，甚至认为这完全就是愚蠢地在浪费时间，毫无意义可言，只要你坚持完成，那对你有所作用，只是所花费的时间更多些而已。

下面教具体你怎么做：

1. 拿一张白纸或者用 Word 新建一个空白文档(我更喜欢后者，因为它更快)。
2. 在最上面写上“我人生的真正目标是什么？”
3. 写下一个头脑突然蹦出的答案(任何答案)，不必是完整的句子，简短的词语也可以。
4. 重复第三步，直到写出能让你哭出来的答案为止，这就是你的人生目标。

就是这样。不管你是顾问、工程师还是健美运动员。对一些人来说，这个练习非常有意义，对其他人来说，这可能看起来非常愚蠢。通常情况下，需要大概15～20分钟的时间理清你头脑里那些杂七杂八的东西和你认为的人生目标是什么的社会条件。从头脑和记忆中来的答案都是错误的，当正确答案最终来的时候，你会感觉它是从一个完全不同的地方来的。

对于那些深陷低意识生活的人来说，会花费更多的时间把所有错误答案写完，可能得一个多小时。不过只要你坚持，写完100个或者200个甚至是500个之后，你会被那个让你激动不已的答案所打动，那个让你崩溃的答案。如果你从未这样做过，你可能会觉得很傻。傻就傻吧，无论如何都要去做。

在你写的过程中，可能某些答案会非常相似。你甚至可能列出以前写过的答案。也可能在切到一个新的话题后写出10-20个答案。没关系，你可以列出你脑海中出现的任何答案，接着写就好了。

在这个过程中的某个时刻(通常在50-100个答案之后)，你可能想要退出，因为思维太发散了。你可能会有起身找借口做其他事情的冲动。这很正常。克服这种阻力，继续写，抗拒的感觉最终会过去的。

You may also discover a few answers that seem to give you a mini-surge of emotion, but they don’t quite make you cry — they’re just a bit off. Highlight those answers as you go along, so you can come back to them to generate new permutations. Each reflects a piece of your purpose, but individually they aren’t complete. When you start getting these kinds of answers, it just means you’re getting warm. Keep going.

It’s important to do this alone and with no interruptions. If you’re a nihilist, then feel free to start with the answer, “I don’t have a purpose,” or “Life is meaningless,” and take it from there. If you keep at it, you’ll still eventually converge.

When I did this exercise, it took me about 25 minutes, and I reached my final answer at step 106. Partial pieces of the answer (mini-surges) appeared at steps 17, 39, and 53, and then the bulk of it fell into place and was refined through steps 100-106. I felt the feeling of resistance (wanting to get up and do something else, expecting the process to fail, feeling very impatient and even irritated) around steps 55-60. At step 80 I took a 2-minute break to close my eyes, relax, clear my mind, and to focus on the intention for the answer to come to me — this was helpful as the answers I received after this break began to have greater clarity.

Here was my final answer: *to live consciously and courageously, to resonate with love and compassion, to awaken the great spirits within others, and to leave this world in peace.*

When you find your own unique answer to the question of why you’re here, you will feel it resonate with you deeply. The words will seem to have a special energy to you, and you will feel that energy whenever you read them.

Discovering your purpose is the easy part. The hard part is keeping it with you on a daily basis and working on yourself to the point where you become that purpose.

If you’re inclined to ask why this little process works, just put that question aside until after you’ve successfully completed it. Once you’ve done that, you’ll probably have your own answer to why it works. Most likely if you ask 10 different people why this works (people who’ve successfully completed it), you’ll get 10 different answers, all filtered through their individual belief systems, and each will contain its own reflection of truth.

Obviously, this process won’t work if you quit before convergence. I’d guesstimate that 80-90% of people should achieve convergence in less than an hour. If you’re really entrenched in your beliefs and resistant to the process, maybe it will take you 5 sessions and 3 hours, but I suspect that such people will simply quit early (like within the first 15 minutes) or won’t even attempt it at all. But if you’re drawn to read this blog (and haven’t been inclined to ban it from your life yet), then it’s doubtful you fall into this group.

Give it a shot! At the very least, you’ll learn one of two things: your true purpose in life -or- that you should unsubscribe from this blog. 😉
